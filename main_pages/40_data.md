## Foam phantoms

The data for the simulated foam phantoms is available [here](https://tomobank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/phantom/docs.phantom.foams.html#challenge) through TomoBank [[1]](#note1), which includes a detailed description. A (free) [Globus account](https://www.globus.org/) is required to download the data. The data of Foam 1 can be used for training and testing of your algorithms, while results should be submitted for the other provided foam samples.

## Fuel cell data

The data for the dynamic fuel cell experiment is available [here](https://tomobank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/data/docs.data.dynamic.html#fuel-cell-data) through TomoBank [[1]](#note1), which includes a detailed description. A (free) [Globus account](https://www.globus.org/) is required to download the data.

## Nano CT data

Are you looking for an even harder problem? We have some nanoCT data that is difficult even for state-of-the-art methods! We have data sets measured using Zernike phase contrast, [here] (https://tomobank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/data/docs.data.nano.html#zernike), and requiring PSF deconvolution, [here] (https://tomobank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/data/docs.data.nano.html#psf), both available through TomoBank [[1]](#note1), which includes a detailed description. A (free) [Globus account](https://www.globus.org/) is required to download the data. This data is not yet officially part of the TomoChallenge--we do not have an official submission script or a way to display submissions on the results page or a way quantitatively evaluate results. We are hoping to soon add all of this for some of these data sets; until then, if you work on this data, feel free to upload your results (through the globus endpoint, see the submission page) and we will reach out to discuss with you more!
